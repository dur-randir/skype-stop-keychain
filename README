This is a wrapper around Skype version 7.x for Mac OS X for people
who prefer it over the new broken & bloated 8.x version.

It's made to prevent Skype from annoyingly asking for a keychain
access (it doesn't matter whether you allow it or deny it - it
just keeps re-asking forever). With this wrapper, it informs
you that your keychain is broken (it now is, for this pesky Skype)
on startup a couple of times (just hit "Cancel"), and then remains
silent (until the next restart).

How to use: checkout and type "make run" in the console.
